## 🗂️ **Project Structure**

The project is organized by levels (cells) with exercises classified into chapters based on the topics covered in the course. Below is a high-level overview of the directory structure:

```bash
.

│   ├── ex00
│   │   └── exercise_0_0.c
│   ├── ex01
│   │   └── exercise_0_1.c
│   └── ex02
│       └── exercise_0_2.c
├── cell1
│   ├── ex00
│   │   └── exercise_1_0.c
│   └── ex01
│       └── exercise_1_1.c
├── cell2
│   ├── ex00

```

### **Key Directories:**

- **`cell0` to `cell4`**: Each directory contains exercises that build on the skills learned in previous levels. 
- **`subject_files`**: This folder contains the subject PDFs that detail the requirements and instructions for each level of the project.

Each exercise helps solidify your understanding of web development and builds on the previous one, creating a gradual progression from basic to more advanced topics.

## 💻 **Technologies Used**

This project leverages a combination of front-end and back-end web technologies:

- **HTML5**: Used to create the structure and content of web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling web pages and making them visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and dynamic content to web pages.
- **Node.js**: Used as a runtime for server-side programming and handling backend logic.

Together, these technologies provide a robust foundation for building modern, responsive web applications.
