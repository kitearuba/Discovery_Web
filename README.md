## Introduction

The Discovery Web project is part of the 42 School curriculum, aimed at providing students with hands-on experience in web development. The project is divided into five sections, from 0 to 4, with the last level (4) being a team exercise. The rest of the levels consist of individual exercises.

## Project Structure

For clarity and better organization, the exercises have been classified into chapters based on the topics covered in the course. Here's a brief overview of the structure:
